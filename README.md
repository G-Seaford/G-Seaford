- 👋 Hi, I’m @G-Seaford
  
- 👀 I’m interested in applying equivariant message-passing neural networks (MPNNs)
     to generate machine-learned interatomic force fields (ML-FFs)
     to simulate systems too complex to be accessed by traditional DFT approaches.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently a PhD student at EPSRC CDT for Modelling Heterogeneous Systems (HetSys)
     focusing on simulating nucleation and electrochemical processes occuring across
     several lengthscales and timescales via machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MLIPs, ML and DFT sims.

- 📫 How to reach me: details are on my website https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/people/cohort6/lucaseaford/
